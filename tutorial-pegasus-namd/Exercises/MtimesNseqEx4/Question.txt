Go to the directory  "tutorial-pegasus-namd/Exercises/MtimesNseqEx4". All the input files related to 
run 1000 sequential NAMD jobs are in the file "inputsM1000N50.tar.gz".  The input files were already 
generated to save time. Uncompress the files by running the command "tar -xvzf inputsM1000N50.tar.gz" that 
will create a directory "inputs" containing all the NAMD input files. The input files represent 
1000-parallel, each of  50-sequential NAMD jobs. Include this information in the dax-generator.
