Under the directory "tutorial-pegasus-namd/Exercises/SingleEx1" you will see relevant files to run 
the single NAMD job with pegasus. However, you need to change few things to run submit the 
job. The errors are associated with the definition of names of dax-generator and NAMD input files. 
You have to correct these two file names in the submit submit.bash and in 
the dax-generator script. 

Hint:
grep dax-generator-singleJob-Ex1.py *
grep ubq_gbis_eq_Ex1.conf *
