Go to the directory  "tutorial-pegasus-namd/Exercises/NSeqEx3". All the input files related to 
run 1000 sequential NAMD jobs are in the file "inputsN1000.tar.gz".  The input files were already 
generated to save time. Uncompress the files by running the command "tar -xvzf inputsN1000.tar.gz" that 
will create a directory "inputs" containing all the NAMD input files.  The dax-generator 
python script needs to know about these 1,000 input files, include this information in the 
dax-generator.
