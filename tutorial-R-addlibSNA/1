Computer Science
Clemson University
(Path sampling for image analysis. Paul already built DAGMan workflow and was successful in running jobs. The jobs 
are based on Python + DAGMan )

2. Using OSG to Estimate Demand of Differentiated Products 
Prof. Fernando Luco
Texas A&M University
(Search problem in Economics model. Already build the workflow with Pegasus and compiled MATLAB applications.  Hope 
to  run the jobs soon. )

3. Online Application of Atlas-based Image Segmentation in Imaging-guided Radiotherapy via HTC
Tingting Zhao
Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, Los Angeles
(Image analysis with elastix package. The proposed work is an excellent fit for HTC ) 

4. Topological data analysis to understand the structure of high dimensional data 
Alex  Georges
Physics/Mathematics
University  of  California, San Diego
(Interesting idea and could be applied to any data.)

5. Biocontrol, Wasps, and Big Data
Kelley Leung
PhD researcher
Breeding Invertebrates for Next Generation Biocontrol (BINGO)
Marie-Curie Innovative Training Network
Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences
University of Groningen
(Interesting work and the proposed data analysis and modeling with R would be a great fit on OSG Connect)


6. Use of high-throughput computing to predict the effect of size inhomogeneity in terahertz quantum dot cascade lasers
Ben Burnett
Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA 
(Modeling quantum dots for lasers. The approach and calculations would be easy to start on OSG Connect with 
MATLAB + DAGMan workflow)
