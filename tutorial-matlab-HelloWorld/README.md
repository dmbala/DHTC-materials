[title]: - "Basics of compiled MATLAB applications - Hello World example"  
[TOC]
 
 
## Overview

[MATLAB®](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) is a licensed high level language and modeling toolkit. The [MATLAB Compiler™](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/) lets you share MATLAB programs as standalone applications.  MATLAB Compiler is invoked with `mcc`. The compiler supports most toolboxes and user-developed 
interfaces. For more details, check the list of [supported toolboxes](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/supported/compiler_support.html) 
and [ineligible programs](http://www.mathworks.com/products/ineligible_programs/).  


All applications created with MATLAB Compiler use [MATLAB Compiler Runtime™ (MCR)](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/), which enables royalty-free deployment and use. We assume you have access to a machine that has MATLAB compiler because the compiler is not available on OSG Connect.  MATLAB Runtime is available 
on OSG Connect. 

Although the compiled binaries are portable, they need to have a compatible execution environment in terms of the 
operating system and matlab version. We recommend the 
compilation of the program with matlab versions 2014a, 2014b, 2015a, or 2015b and on machines with 
Scientific Linux version 5, 6 or 7 so that the compiled binaries are portable on OSG machines.  

In this tutorial, we learn the basics of compiling MATLAB programs on a licensed linux machine and running the 
compiled binaries using MCR on the OSG machines. 


### MATLAB script: `hello_world.m` 

Lets start with a simple MATLAB script `hello_world.m` that prints `Hello World!` to standard output. 
    
    function helloworld
        fprintf('\n=============')
        fprintf('\nHello, World!\n')
        fprintf('=============\n')
    end  

### Compilation 

OSG connect does not have a license to use the MATLAB compiler. On a Linux machine with a MATLAB 
license, invoke the compiler `mcc`.  We turn off all graphical options (`-nodisplay`), disable Java (`-nojvm`), and instruct MATLAB to run this application as a single-threaded application (`-singleCompThread`):

    mcc -m -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm hello_world.m

The flag `-m` means C language translation during compilation, and the flag `-R` indicates runtime options.  The compilation would produce the files: 

    `hello_world, run_hello_world.sh, mccExcludedFiles.log` and `readme.txt`

The file `hello_world` is the standalone executable. The file `run_hello_world.sh` is MATLAB generated shell script. `mccExcludedFiles.log` is the log file and `readme.txt` contains the information about the compilation process. We just need the standalone binary file `hello_world`. 

## Running standalone binary applications on OSG

To see which releases are available on OSG:

    $ ssh username@login.osgconnect.net   # login on OSG connect login node
    $ module avail matlab
    
    ----------- /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/modulefiles/Core ----------
    matlab/2013b    matlab/2014a    matlab/2014b    matlab/2015a (D)

    Where:
     (D):  Default Module

    Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
    Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching any of the "keys".


### Tutorial files

Let us say you have created the standalone binary `hello_world`. Transfer the file `hello_world` to login.osgconnect.net. Alternatively, you may also use the readily available files by invoking the `tutorial` command: 


    $ tutorial matlab-HelloWorld # Copies input and script files to the directory tutorial-matlab-HelloWorld.
 
This will create a directory `tutorial-matlab-HelloWorld`. Inside the directory, you will see the following files
   
    hello_world             # compiled executable binary of hello_world.m
    hello_world.m           # matlab program
    hello_world.submit      # condor job description file
    hello_world.sh          # execution script

### Executing the MATLAB application binary

The compilation and execution environment need to the same. The file `hello_world` is a standalone binary of the matlab program `hello_world.m` which was compiled using MATLAB 2014b on a Linux platform. The login node and many of the worker nodes on OSG are based on Linux platform. In addition to the platform requirement, we also need to have the same MATLAB Runtime version. 

Load the MATLAB runtime for 2014b version via module command.  On the terminal prompt, type

    $ module load matlab/2014b 

The above command sets up the environment to run the matlab/2014b runtime applications.  Now execute the binary

    $ ./hello_world
    (would produce the following output)

    =============
    Hello, World!
    =============

If you get the above output, the binary execution is successful. Next, we see how to submit the job on a remote worker machine using HTcondor. 

### Job execution and submission files

Let us take a look at `hello_world.submit` file: 


    Universe = vanilla                          # One OSG Connect vanilla, the preffered job universe is "vanilla"

    Executable =  hello_world.sh                # Job execution file which is transffered to worker machine
    transfer_input_files = hello_world          # list of file(s) need be transffered to the remote worker machine 

    Output = Log/job.$(Process).out⋅            # standard output 
    Error =  Log/job.$(Process).err             # standard error
    Log =    Log/job.$(Process).log             # log information about job execution
    
    requirements = OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 6" && Arch == "X86_64" && HAS_MODULES == True 
    queue 10                                     # Submit 10  jobs


The wrapper script `hello_world.sh`  

    #!/bin/bash
    source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/lmod/current/init/bash
    module load matlab/2014b
    chmod +x hello_world
    ./hello_world

loads the correct matlab module and executes the binary. 

Before we submit the job, make sure that the directory `Log` exists on the current working directory. Because HTcondor looks for `Log` directory to copy the standard output, error and log files as specified in the job description file. 

From your work directory, type

    $ mkdir -p Log

Absence of `Log` directory would send the jobs to held state. 

### Job submmision 

We submit the job using the `condor_submit` command as follows

	$ condor_submit hello_world.submit //Submit the condor job description file "hello_world.submit"

Now you have submitted an ensemble of 10 MATLAB jobs. Each job prints `hello world` on the standard 
output. Check the status of the submitted job,  

	$ condor_q username  # The status of the job is printed on the screen. Here, username is your login name.


### Job outputs 

The `hello_world.m` script sends the output to standard output. In the condor job description file, we expressed that the standard output is written on the `Log/job.$(ProcessID).out`. After job completion, ten output files are produced with the `hello world` message under the directory `Log`. 

## What's next? 
Sure, it is not very exciting to print the same message on 10 output files. In the subsequent MATLAB 
examples,  we see  how to scale up MATLAB computation on HTC environment.
