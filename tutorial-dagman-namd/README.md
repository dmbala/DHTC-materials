<h2> Overview </h2>

In High Throughput Computing, one is typically faced with having to manage a large set of computational tasks. This can include situations in which tasks may depend on one another. Workflow management systems can help relieve job management burden for you, the user. [DAGMan](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.5/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html) (Directed Acyclic Graph Manager) is a workflow management system based on graphs (see figures below) build into HTCondor. DAGMan handles sets of computational jobs that can be described as a set of nodes in a ["directed acyclic graph"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). This means that the job dependencies do not form a loop, see "Cyclic" vs. "Acyclic" figure below. 

![fig 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-dagman-namd/master/DAGManImages/Slide1.png)

In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply DAGMan to help us manage jobs and job interdependencies. First, we will revisit the optimization example from in the previous section. Second, we will manage a set of molecular dynamics (_MD_) simulations using the [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) program. NAMD is conventionally used in highly parallel HPC settings, scaling to thousands of cores managed by a single job. One can achieve the same scaling and ease of management in [HTC systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_computing) using thousands of individual jobs using workflow tools such as DAGMan.

<h2> Running Jobs with DAGMan </h2>  

DAGMan offers an elegant and simple solution to reduce the management burden on you (the user) if you have more than a handful of jobs to run or there are jobs that dependent on each other. For example, if you have a set of jobs that may take longer than 2-3 hours to complete, a subset of your jobs may be terminated prematurely. Managing the resubmission of prematurely terminated jobs manually is not practical in most cases. DAGMan tracks which jobs were terminated prematurely, and allows you to resubmit the terminated jobs with one command. Similarly, if you have a set of jobs that depend on each other in some way, DAGMan has the functionality to allow you define these dependencies and manage them for you.

<h3> Job Management with DAGMan </h3>

The first examples, we will revisit the example from the previous section. In this example, we had a job that we first wanted to execute a several times and subsequently with a set of input parameters. 

The DAGMan script and the necessary files are available to the user by invoking the `tutorial` command. 

    $ tutorial dagman-namd
    $ cd tutorial-dagman-namd/JobManagementDAG

The directory `tutorial-dagman-namd/JobManagementDAG` contains all the necessary files. The file `jobmanagement.dag` is the DAGMan input file.

Let us take a look at the DAG file `jobmanagement.dag`.  

    $ cat jobmanagement.dag 

    ######DAG file###### 
    ##### Define Jobs ###
    #####  JOB JobName JobDescriptionFile
    JOB A0 run_job.submit
    JOB A1 run_job.submit
    JOB A2 run_job.submit
    JOB A3 run_job.submit

To define a job (or node in DAG lingo), we have a line beginning with the keyword `JOB` followed by a unique identifier for that job, for example, `A0` for the first job and, the HTCondor submit file to be used, i.e. `run_job.submit`.  A line starting with pound (#) character is a comment. The submit file `run_job.submit` is the same as in the previous example modulo the last time that now reads `Queue 1`, see:

    $ cat run_job.submit

    # The UNIVERSE defines an execution environment. You will almost always use VANILLA.
    Universe = vanilla

    # These are good base requirements for your jobs on the OSG. It is specific on OS and
    # OS version, core, and memory, and wants to use the software modules. 
    Requirements = OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 6" && TARGET.Arch == "X86_64" && HAS_MODULES == True 
    request_cpus = 1
    request_memory = 1 GB

    # executable is the program your job will run It's often useful
    # to create a shell script to "wrap" your actual work.
    executable = scalingup-python-wrapper.sh 

    # files transferred into the job sandbox
    transfer_input_files = rosen_brock_brute_opt.py

    # error and output are the error and output channels from your job
    # that HTCondor returns from the remote host.
    output = Log/job.out.$(Cluster).$(Process)
    error = Log/job.error.$(Cluster).$(Process)


    # The log file is where HTCondor places information about your
    # job's status, success, and resource consumption.
    log = Log/job.log.$(Cluster).$(Process)

    # Send the job to Held state on failure. 
    on_exit_hold = (ExitBySignal == True) || (ExitCode != 0)  

    # Periodically retry the jobs every 60 seconds, up to a maximum of 5 retries. 
    # The RANDOM_INTEGER(60, 600, 120) means random integers are generated between 
    # 60 and 600 seconds with a step size of 120 seconds. The failed jobs are 
    # randomly released with a spread of 1-10 minutes.  Releasing multiple jobs at 
    # the same time causes stress for the login node, so the random spread is a 
    # good approach to periodically release the failed jobs. 

    PeriodicRelease = ( (CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) > $RANDOM_INTEGER(60, 600, 120) ) && ((NumJobStarts < 5))

    # Queue is the "start button" - it launches any jobs that have been
    # specified thus far.
    queue 1

We submit the DAGMan task using the command `condor_submit_dag` 

    $ condor_submit_dag jobmanagement.dag 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    

Let's monitor the job status every two seconds. (Recall `connect watch` from a previous lesson.)

    $ connect watch 2

    -- Submitter: login01.osgconnect.net : <192.170.227.195:48781> : login01.osgconnect.net
    ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD

    4 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 4 idle, 1 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

We see five running jobs. One is the DAGMan job which manages the execution of jobs inside the DAG. The others are the jobs controlled by the DAG.  We need to type `Ctrl-C` to exit from watch command. Once the DAG completes, the queue will be empty. 

<h4> Supplying Variables to Jobs in DAGMan </h4>

Let's take this a step further. In the previous section, we wanted to supply some boundary conditions to the calulation using the `argument` keyword. The same is possible with DAGMan. Taking a look at `jobmanagement_supplyvars.dag`:

    $ cat jobmanagement_supplyvars.dag 

    ######DAG file###### 
    ##### Define Jobs ###
    #####  JOB JobName JobDescriptionFile
    JOB A0 run_job_vars.submit
    JOB A1 run_job_vars.submit
    JOB A2 run_job_vars.submit
    JOB A3 run_job_vars.submit

    VARS A0 x_low="-9" x_high="9" y_low="-9" y_high="9"
    VARS A1 x_low="-8" x_high="8" y_low="-8" y_high="8"
    VARS A2 x_low="-7" x_high="7" y_low="-7" y_high="7"
    VARS A3 x_low="-6" x_high="6" y_low="-6" y_high="6"

From `jobmanagement.dag`, we added four lines starting with the keyword `VARS`. Each line follows a similar pattern to the job definition line we looked at above: `VARS <unique_ID_job> <list_of_variables>`. Please note that the variable values have to be in `""` independent on whether they are numbers, strings, etc. 

Now we take a look at `run_job_vars.submit`:

    $cat run_job_vars.submit

    # The UNIVERSE defines an execution environment. You will almost always use VANILLA.
    Universe = vanilla

    # These are good base requirements for your jobs on the OSG. It is specific on OS and
    # OS version, core, and memory, and wants to use the software modules. 
    Requirements = OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 6" && TARGET.Arch == "X86_64" && HAS_MODULES == True 
    request_cpus = 1
    request_memory = 1 GB

    # executable is the program your job will run It's often useful
    # to create a shell script to "wrap" your actual work.
    executable = scalingup-python-wrapper.sh 

    # files transferred into the job sandbox
    transfer_input_files = rosen_brock_brute_opt.py

    # error and output are the error and output channels from your job
    # that HTCondor returns from the remote host.
    output = Log/job.out.$(Cluster).$(Process)
    error = Log/job.error.$(Cluster).$(Process)


    # The log file is where HTCondor places information about your
    # job's status, success, and resource consumption.
    log = Log/job.log.$(Cluster).$(Process)

    # Send the job to Held state on failure. 
    on_exit_hold = (ExitBySignal == True) || (ExitCode != 0)  

    # Periodically retry the jobs every 60 seconds, up to a maximum of 5 retries. 
    # The RANDOM_INTEGER(60, 600, 120) means random integers are generated between 
    # 60 and 600 seconds with a step size of 120 seconds. The failed jobs are 
    # randomly released with a spread of 1-10 minutes.  Releasing multiple jobs at 
    # the same time causes stress for the login node, so the random spread is a 
    # good approach to periodically release the failed jobs. 

    PeriodicRelease = ( (CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) > $RANDOM_INTEGER(60, 600, 120) ) && ((NumJobStarts < 5))

    # Command-line arguments passed to the executable
    arguments = $(x_low) $(x_high) $(y_low) $(y_high)

    # Queue is the "start button" - it launches any jobs that have been
    # specified thus far.
    queue 1

It is the same as `run_job.submit` with the added line `arguments = $(x_low) $(x_high) $(y_low) $(y_high)`.

<h4> DAGMan Log Files </h4>

When submitting a DAGMan job, HTCondor helpfully tells you what the log files are named and what their use is:

    $ condor_submit_dag jobmanagement.dag 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    File for submitting this DAG to Condor           : jobmanagement.dag.condor.sub
    Log of DAGMan debugging messages                 : jobmanagement.dag.dagman.out
    Log of Condor library output                     : jobmanagement.dag.lib.out
    Log of Condor library error messages             : jobmanagement.dag.lib.err
    Log of the life of condor_dagman itself          : jobmanagement.dag.dagman.log
    
    Submitting job(s).
    1 job(s) submitted to cluster 1317501.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
The most important log here is `jobmanagement.dag.dagman.out`. It allows you to monitor the progress of the workflow, what jobs were just submitted, and how many jobs are at the various stages of submission, i.e. in the `PRE` or `POST` script phase, how many are `Ready` to be submitted, how many are waiting for other jobs to finish (`Un-Ready`), how many have failed or completed. Don't worry we will explain some of these terms in the following examples. Taking a look at this file:

    $ cat jobmanagement.dag.dagman.out

<h4> Job Retry and Rescue </h4>

In the above examples, we use an independent set of jobs. What happens if any of these jobs fail? DAGMan can help with the resubmission of uncompleted portions of a DAG, when one or more nodes result in failure.  

<h4> Job Retry </h4>

Say for example, job `A2` in the above example is important and you want to eliminate the possibility as much as possible. One way is to retry the specific job `A2` a few times. DAGMan would retry failed jobs when you specify the following line at the end of dag file:

    $ nano jobmanagement.dag # Open the jobmanagement.dag file
     

At the end of the `jobmanagement.dag` file
     
    Retry A2 3 # This means re-try job A2 for three times in case of failures. 
    

If you want to retry jobs `A2` and `A3` for 7 times, edit the `jobmanagement.dag`: 
     
    ### At the end of the linear.dag file
    Retry A2 7 # This means re-try job A2 for up to seven times in case of failures.
    Retry A3 7 # This means re-try job A3 for up to seven times in case of failures.
 
<h4> Rescue DAG </h4>

If DAGMan fails to complete the list of tasks, it creates a rescue DAG file with a suffix `.rescueXXX`, where `XXX` is a number starting at `001`. The rescue DAG file contains the information about which jobs have completed and which have failed or haven't completed. Say for example, in our workflow of four linear jobs, the jobs `A0` and `A1` finished, `A2` failed, and `A3` is incomplete. In such a case, we do not want to start executing the jobs all over again but rather we want to start from `A2`. This information is embedded in the rescue DAG file. In our example of `linear.dag`, the rescue DAG file would be `linear.dag.rescue001`. We re-submit the DAG:

    $ condor_submit_dag jobmanagement.dag

and HTCondor will automatically detect the rescue DAG and use it to only submit the jobs that have yet to sucessfully complete. 

<h4> Submission Tuning </h4>

One additional feature of DAGMan is that you are able to tune how many total jobs to have sitting in the queue or how fast jobs are submitted to the cluster. This is especially important if you have fairly large number of jobs, i.e. more than 10000. HTCondor can handle up to 200000 jobs in the queue simultaneously, but only on dedicated and specialized hardware. To accomodate other users on the OSG Connect system and reduce stress on the system, we recommend that you keep less than 30000 jobs in the queue in the idle state. 

DAGMan can be configured to allow you operate within those limits. The simplest way is to pass a text file with your configuration parameters to `condor_submit_dag`: `condor_submit_dag -config dagman.config your_dag.dag`. The configuration file will look something like:

    DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE=30000
    DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL=1
    DAGMAN_MAX_SUBMITS_PER_INTERVAL=10

`DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE` tells your DAGMan job to limit the maximum number of jobs that are sitting in the queue to be 30000. `DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL` tells your DAGMan how often to look for a changed job state, i.e. that a job failed or completed. `DAGMAN_MAX_SUBMITS_PER_INTERVAL` is to tune how many jobs DAGMan submits every interval. The last two variables are for tuning how rapidly and how many jobs are submitted. For more configuration parameters and their documentation, go [here](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/3_3Configuration.html#sec:DAGMan-Config-File-Entries)

<h3> Managing Job Interdependecy with DAGMan </h3>

In our second example, we will use four MD simulations that have some level of job interdependence. 

<h4> Linear DAG </h4>

A linear job dependence means that they will be submitted sequentially by HTCondor. For the sake of simplicity, we have artifically reduced the number of computation steps for each simulation.

![fig 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-dagman-namd/master/DAGManImages/Slide2.png)

Instead of running the four jobs from the above example independently, we want to run them sequentially, i.e. `A0-->A1-->A2-->A3`. In these calculations, the output files from the job `A0` serves as an input for the job `A1` and so forth. These set of jobs clearly represents an acyclic graph. In DAGMan language, job `A0` is parent of job `A1`, job `A1` is parent of `A2` and job `A2` is parent of `A3`. 

First:

    $ cd ../LinearDAG

Let us take a look at the DAG file `linear.dag`.  

    $ cat linear.dag 

    ######DAG file###### 
    ##### Define Jobs ###
    #####  JOB JobName JobDescriptionFile
    JOB A0 namd_run_job0.submit
    JOB A1 namd_run_job1.submit
    JOB A2 namd_run_job2.submit
    JOB A3 namd_run_job3.submit

    ##### Relationship between Jobs ###
    ##### PARENT JobName CHILD JobName
    PARENT A0 CHILD A1
    PARENT A1 CHILD A2
    PARENT A2 CHILD A3

The file looks similar to the one used for the no dependency example above. The main addition are the last three lines containing the definition of the job interdependency. The `PARENT` and `CHILD` commands describes the dependency between jobs, where a job(s) following the `PARENT` command need to successfully complete before jobs following `CHILD` command are submitted. 

If we now submit the DAG:

    $ condor_submit_dag linear.dag

Let's monitor the job status every two seconds. (Recall `connect watch` from a previous lesson.)

    $ connect watch 2

    2 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 4 idle, 1 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

Only two jobs are running now: the DAGMan job and the top-level parent, i.e. job `A0`. `A1` through `A3` will have to wait until their parent job(s) have completed before the are executed.

<h4> PRE and POST processing of jobs </h4>

![fig 3a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-dagman-namd/master/DAGManImages/Slide07.png)

Sometimes, we need to perform a task before a job is submitted or after it is completed. Such pre-processing and post-processing are handled in DAGMan via SCRIPT command. Now let us see how this work for the linear DAG of NAMD jobs. 

    $ cd ../LinearDAG-PrePost
    $ cat linear_prepost.dag

    ######DAG file###### 
    ##### Define Jobs ###
    #####  JOB JobName JobDescriptionFile
    JOB A0 namd_run_job0.submit
    JOB A1 namd_run_job1.submit
    JOB A2 namd_run_job2.submit
    JOB A3 namd_run_job3.submit

    ##### Relationship between Jobs ###
    ##### PARENT JobName CHILD JobName
    PARENT A0 CHILD A1
    PARENT A1 CHILD A2
    PARENT A2 CHILD A3

    ##### PRE or POST processing of a job
    ##### SCRIPT PRE/POST JobName ProcessScript
    SCRIPT PRE   A0  pre-script-temperature.sh
    SCRIPT POST  A3  post-script-energy.sh

Except the last four lines block, this DAG file `linear-post.dag` is same as the previous DAG file `linear.dag`. The script block specifies a pre script and/or post script and which job they are associated with. 

The pre script `pre-script-temperature.sh` sets the temperature for the simulations and it is processed before the job `A0`.  This means the pre script is the first thing processed before any job is submitted.  The post script `post-script-energy.sh` runs after finishing all the simulation jobs `A0`, `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`. It extracts the energy values from the simulation results.  Both pre and post scripts are executed on the local submit machines and not on a remote worker. These scripts should be as lightweight processes as possible.

<h4> Parallel DAG </h4>

![fig 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-dagman-namd/master/DAGManImages/Slide3.png)

Now we consider the workflow of two-linear set of jobs `A0`, `A1`, `B0` and `B1`. Again these are NAMD jobs. The job `A0` is parent of `A1` and the job `B0` is the parent of `B1`. The jobs `A0` and `A1` do not depend on `B0` and/or `B1`. This means we have two parallel workflows that are represented as `A0->A1` and `B0->B1`. The arrow shows the order of job execution. This example is located at 

    $ cd tutorial-dagman-namd/TwoLinearDAG

The directory contains the input files, job submission files and execution scripts.  What is missing here is the `.dag` file. See if you can write the DAGfile for this example and submit the job. 

<h4> X-DAG </h4>
We consider one more example workflow that allows the cross communication between two parallel pipelines. The jobs `A0` and `B0` are two independent NAMD simulations. After finishing `A0` and `B0`, we do some analysis with the job `X`. The jobs `A1` and `B1` are two MD simulations independent of each other. The `X` job determines what is the simulation temperature of MD simulations `A1` and `B1`. In DAGMan lingo, `X` is the parent of `A1` and `B1`.  

![fig 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-dagman-namd/master/DAGManImages/Slide4.png)

The input files, job submission files and execution scripts of the jobs are located in the `X-DAG` subdirectory:

    $ cd tutorial-dagman-namd/X-DAG

Again we are missing the `.dag` file here. See if you can write the DAG file for this example. Hint: Does the job in the center actually need to do anything (is it a NOOP in programming speak)? Check the DAGMan docs!
 

<h2> Keypoints </h2>
- [x] DAGMan handles computational jobs that are mapped as a directed acyclic graph.
- [x] `condor_submit_dag` is the command to submit a DAGMan task. 
- [x] One may write DAGMan files consisting of several DAGMan tasks.
